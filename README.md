📌 About Me

Hi! I'm Albin Lopez, a Software Development student at ITLA (Instituto Tecnológico de Las Américas). I'm passionate about technology, always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills in programming and software design.


💻 I enjoy building creative, functional, and user-friendly applications.

🎹 I'm also a musician — I play the piano and love expressing myself through music.

🎮 I’m a video game enthusiast, interested in how games are made and how they bring people together.

🙏 Faith plays an important role in my life — I enjoy spending time at church, where I find peace and inspiration.


I’m here on GitHub to share my journey, showcase my projects, and collaborate with other passionate developers. Let’s connect and create something awesome together!
